  <p class="lede">An experimental research project into how conversational AI tone influences behaviour—designed for academic and industry collaboration.</p>

  <div class="kicker">What it is</div>
  <p>Project ECHO is studying how variations in chatbot tone and phrasing may shape user trust, compliance, experience and decision-making. Our intent is to isolate conversational style from content and trace its effects.</p>
  <p>Our hypothesis extends beyond user experience: subtle cues in conversational AI can activate parasympathetic emotional responses—the calm, trust-building side of the nervous system—shaping how people process choices. We are exploring these links between tone, behaviour, and underlying brain chemistry.</p>

    <ul class="list-plain">
      <li>Focus: tone-of-voice in LLM chat UX</li>
      <li>Design: controlled style variants</li>
      <li>Measures: trust, task outcomes, language mirroring</li>
      <li>Outputs: open methods; selective data sharing</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="kicker">Why it matters</div>
  <p>Conversational AIs increasingly mediate decisions in education, finance, healthcare, and public services. Even small stylistic shifts—apologies, hedging, or assertiveness—may trigger neurochemical responses (oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin) that alter perceptions of credibility, fairness, and safety. Understanding this helps ensure these systems are designed transparently and responsibly.</p>

<div class="col span-12">
  <div class="kicker">Our philosophy</div>
  <p>Project ECHO is grounded in ten guiding design principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Isolation of style from content</li>
    <li>Pre-registered measures</li>
    <li>Respect for participants</li>
    <li>Generalisable patterns over quirks</li>
    <li>Privacy by design</li>
    <li>User-centric methods</li>
    <li>Transparent data practices</li>
    <li>Ethics first</li>
    <li>Cross-disciplinary review</li>
    <li>Iterative refinement</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These principles ensure that our work is rigorous, transparent, and ethically grounded.</p>
