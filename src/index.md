# Project ECHO  
An experimental research project into how conversational AI tone influences behaviour—designed for academic and industry collaboration.

## What it is  
Project ECHO is studying how variations in chatbot **style and phrasing** may shape user trust, compliance, experience and decision-making. Our intent is to isolate conversational style from content and trace its effects.  

Our focus extends beyond user experience to how subtle cues in conversational AI might activate **parasympathetic emotional responses**—the calm, trust-building side of the nervous system—shaping how people process choices. We are exploring the links between conversational style, behaviour and implied changes in brain chemistry.

Even small stylistic shifts — such as **apologies, hedging (cautious language like “might” or “seems”), affirmation, or assertiveness** — can alter how people respond.

## Why now  
The pace of AI-driven change continues to accelerate—seemingly exponentially—and we are not aware of anyone else approaching the issue in this way.  

---

## Call for collaboration  
We are seeking academic, industry, and independent collaborators **now**.  

Our first **public beta** will launch **01 September 2025**.
