  <div class="kicker">What it is</div>
  <p>Project ECHO is studying how variations in chatbot style and phrasing may shape user trust, compliance, experience, and decision-making. Our intent is to isolate conversational style from content and trace its effects.</p>
  <p>Our focus extends beyond user experience to how subtle cues in conversational AI might activate parasympathetic emotional responses — the calm, trust-building side of the nervous system — shaping how people process choices. We are exploring the links between style, behaviour, and implied brain chemistry.</p>

  <hr class="rule">

  <div class="kicker">Road ahead</div>
  <p>Our roadmap is not yet fixed. Possible outcomes include the release of open-source design principles and frameworks, research collaborations, datasets, and other outputs shaped by what we learn — and by who joins us.</p>
