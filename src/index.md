  <h1>Project ECHO</h1>
  <p class="lede">A disciplined inquiry into how conversational AI tone influences behaviour—designed for academic and industry collaboration.</p>

  <div class="kicker">What it is</div>
  <p>Project ECHO is studying how variations in chatbot tone and phrasing may shape user trust, compliance, and decision-making. Our intent is to isolate conversational style from task content and measure behavioural effects with methodological rigour.</p>
  <p>The public site is intentionally brief. If you’d like the full protocol, instruments, and data schemas, please get in touch via the Participate page.</p>

    <ul class="list-plain">
      <li>Focus: tone-of-voice in LLM chat UX</li>
      <li>Design: controlled style variants</li>
      <li>Measures: trust, task outcomes, language mirroring</li>
      <li>Outputs: open methods; selective data sharing</li>

<div class="col span-12">
  <div class="kicker">Why it matters</div>
  <p>Conversational AIs increasingly mediate decisions in education, finance, healthcare, and public services. Small stylistic shifts—apologies, hedging, or assertiveness—may nudge behaviour in non-obvious ways. ECHO seeks to make those effects visible, measurable, and responsibly governed.</p>

<div class="col span-12">
  <div class="kicker">Our philosophy</div>
  <p>Project ECHO is grounded in ten guiding design principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Isolation of style from content</li>
    <li>Pre-registered measures</li>
    <li>Respect for participants</li>
    <li>Generalisable patterns over quirks</li>
    <li>Privacy by design</li>
    <li>User-centric methods</li>
    <li>Transparent data practices</li>
    <li>Ethics first</li>
    <li>Cross-disciplinary review</li>
    <li>Iterative refinement</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These principles ensure that our work is rigorous, transparent, and ethically grounded.</p>
