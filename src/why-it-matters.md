  <h1>Why It Matters</h1>
  <p class="lede">Conversational AI is becoming the interface for work, learning, and daily life. What’s underexplored is how <em>style</em>—not just content—affects outcomes.</p>
  <hr class="rule">
</div>

<div class="col span-12">
  <p>Even small shifts in <strong>conversational style</strong>—such as <strong>apologies</strong>, <strong>hedging</strong> (cautious language like “might” or “seems”), <strong>assertiveness</strong>, <strong>affirmation</strong>, or <strong>encouragement</strong>—can influence trust, authority, and fairness. These effects show up in behaviour: whether people comply, challenge, or mirror the AI. From such shifts we can infer the underlying neurochemical responses at play—<em>without</em> measuring brain chemistry directly.</p>

  <div class="kicker">Why our approach is different</div>
  <p>Much of what’s known is either locked inside dense academic papers or kept behind the firewalls of big tech. Project ECHO takes a different path: combining the flexibility of a startup, a user-centric mindset shaped by decades in experience design, and deep industry expertise. We work in the open—publishing methods, inviting scrutiny, and collaborating across disciplines.</p>

  <div class="kicker">Why now</div>
  <p>The rate of AI-driven change is accelerating—seemingly exponentially—and we’re not aware of anyone else looking at it quite this way. The stakes are high, and clarity is urgent.</p>
