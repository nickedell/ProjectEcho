  <h1>Why It Matters.</h1>
  <p class="lede">Conversational AIs increasingly mediate decisions in education, finance, healthcare andpublic services. Even small stylistic shifts — apologies, hedging, assertiveness, affirmation, or encouragement — may trigger responses that alter perceptions of credibility, fairness andsafety. Understanding this helps ensure these systems are designed transparently and responsibly.</p>

<div class="col span-12">
  <p>Even small shifts in <strong>conversational style</strong>—such as <strong>apologies</strong>, <strong>hedging</strong> (cautious language such as “might” or “seems”), <strong>assertiveness</strong>, <strong>affirmation</strong> or <strong>encouragement</strong>—can influence trust, authority and the perception of fairness. These effects are reflected in people's behaviour: whether they comply, challenge or mirror the AI. From such shifts we can infer the underlying neurochemical responses at play—<em>without</em> measuring brain chemistry directly.</p>

  <p>The rate of AI-driven change continues to accelerate — seemingly exponentially — and we are not aware of anyone else studying these tonal and behavioural effects in quite this way.</p>
