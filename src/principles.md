  <h1>Principles</h1>
  <p class="lede">Project ECHO is guided by ten design principles. They are living anchors we’ll refine through collaboration and evidence.</p>
  <hr class="rule">
</div>

<div class="col span-6">
  <ol>
	<li><strong>Isolate Style, Not Content</strong> We control for what’s being said, so we can study the impact of how it’s said.</li>
	<li><strong>Measure Behaviour First</strong> We don’t aim to measure brain chemistry directly. We look at observable behaviour, from which changes in underlying state can be inferred.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus on Subtlety</strong> Small shifts—apologies, hedging, affirmation, encouragement, assertiveness—can meaningfully shape trust and compliance.</li>
	<li><strong>Ground in Neuroscience</strong> We reference parasympathetic responses and social bonding mechanisms, while staying focused on practical, measurable outcomes.</li>
	<li><strong>Responsible by Design</strong> Balance curiosity with safety, consent, and governance at every step.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="col span-6">
  <ol start="6">
	<li><strong>Social and Ethical Context</strong> Work transparently; publish methods and findings for scrutiny and reuse.</li>
	<li><strong>Design Lens</strong> Apply decades of experience design so findings transfer to real interactions, not just theory.</li>
	<li><strong>Collaboration by Default</strong> Seek partners across academia, industry, and practice. Invite critique.</li>
	<li><strong>Startup-style Agility</strong> Move quickly, adapt as we learn, and explore questions others may overlook.</li>
	<li><strong>Future-Facing</strong> Expect outcomes like design frameworks, best-practice principles, and new modes of collaboration. The roadmap is intentionally open.</li>
  </ol>

	<li><strong>Design principles & frameworks</strong> for responsible conversational AI</li>
	<li><strong>Collaborative projects</strong> across academia, startups and public institutions</li>
	<li><strong>Shared datasets & instruments</strong> that support replication and critique</li>
	<li><strong>Practical toolkits</strong> for designers, strategists and policy-makers</li>
