# Our Principles  

Project ECHO is guided by 10 design principles. They are intended as living anchors—reference points we expect to refine through collaboration and evidence.  

1. **Isolate the variable** — Focus on conversational style independent of content.  
2. **Measure behaviour, not claims** — Track how people act, not just what they say.  
3. **Infer, don’t intrude** — Behavioural data can imply neurochemical shifts; we won’t attempt to measure brain chemistry directly.  
4. **Respect participants** — Design with ethical safeguards and transparency.  
5. **Work in the open** — Publish methods and findings for scrutiny.  
6. **Stay multidisciplinary** — Draw on psychology, neuroscience, UX, and industry practice.  
7. **Bias-check continuously** — Guard against skew in both data and interpretation.  
8. **Collaborate widely** — Invite peers, critics, and partners into the process.  
9. **Design for actionability** — Produce outputs that can inform design and strategy, not just theory.  
10. **Stay adaptive** — Keep principles and methods open to change as evidence emerges.

## Possible Outcomes  

Our roadmap is not yet set. Possible outputs may include:  
- **Design principles and frameworks** for conversational AI.  
- **Published datasets** to support replication and critique.  
- **Collaborative projects** with academia, startups, or public institutions.  
- **Practical toolkits** for experience designers, strategists, and policy makers.
