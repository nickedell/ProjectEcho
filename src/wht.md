# Why It Matters  

Conversational AI is no longer novel—it is a core interface for work, learning, and daily life.  
What remains underexplored is how **style**—not just content—affects outcomes.  

Most research to date is either:  
- **Highly academic**, published in journals with slow feedback loops and limited public accessibility, or  
- **Behind closed doors** inside the companies that build large language models.  

Project ECHO offers a different path:  
- The **flexibility of a startup**, unencumbered by bureaucracy.  
- A **user-centric mindset**, grounded in decades of experience design.  
- **Deep industry expertise** spanning strategy, technology, and behaviour.  

We commit to working in the open:  
- Publishing our methodologies transparently.  
- Sharing results for public scrutiny.  
- Actively seeking collaboration and critique.  

By doing so, we hope to bridge the gap between theory and practice, building evidence that is both rigorous and actionable.
