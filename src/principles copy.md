  <p class="lede">Project ECHO is guided by ten design principles. They are living anchors we’ll refine through collaboration and evidence.</p>

  <ol>
	<li><strong>Isolate Style, Not Content</strong> We control for what’s being said, so we can study the impact of how it’s said.</li>
	<li><strong>Measure Behaviour First</strong>We don’t aim to measure brain chemistry directly. Instead, we look at observable behaviour, from which changes in underlying state can be inferred.</li>
	<li><strong>Ground in Neuroscience</strong>Our work references parasympathetic responses and social bonding mechanisms, but we remain focused on practical, measurable outcomes.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus on Subtlety</strong>Our work references parasympathetic responses and social bonding mechanisms, but we remain focused on practical, measurable outcomes.</li>
	<li><strong>Social and Ethical Context</strong> Publish methods and findings for scrutiny and reuse.</li>
  </ol>

	<li><strong>Design Lens</strong>We bring decades of experience design practice, ensuring that findings are applied to real-world interactions, not just theory.</li>
	<li><strong>Startup-style Agility</strong>We can move quickly, adapt as we learn, and explore questions the big tech players may overlook.</li>
	<li><strong>Collaboration by Default</strong>We actively seek partners across academia, industry, and practice. Project ECHO is open for scrutiny and contribution.</li>
	<li><strong>Future-Facing*</strong>Our outcomes may take the form of design frameworks, principles for best practice, or new modes of collaboration. The roadmap is not fixed.</li>
	<li><strong>Responsible by Design</strong>We balance curiosity with responsibility, recognising both the potential and risks of conversational AI.</li>
